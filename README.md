### Hey everybody! 👋🏽
Welcome to my coding journey! My name is Tierra. 

🌱 I am currently learning intermediate and advanced-level Python and Generative AI. After completing these two languages, I want to learn many other programming languages that interests me.

👯‍♀️ I'm looking forward to collaborating on open source projects to sharpen my coding skills. 

🔭 I'm practicing with tutorials and online resources. I intend on contributing to open source projects soon.

✨ My goals for the future are working in industries such as Business, Cybersecurity, Finance, or FinTech and learning more about Web 3.0. 💼👩🏽‍💻📈💵

✅ I'm willing to adapt and try new things to level up my skills. Knowledge is power! 🧠📚
