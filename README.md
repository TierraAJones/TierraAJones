### Hey everybody! 👋🏽
Welcome to my coding journey! My name is Tierra, but you can call me TJ if you'd like. 

I am currently learning Python and SQL. After completing these two languages, I want to learn Javascript, Solidity and many other languages that interests me.

I'm practicing with tutorials and online resources. I intend on contributing to open source projects soon.

My goals for the future are working in industries such as Business Intelligence, Cybersecurity, Finance, or FinTech and learn more about Web 3.0. 💼👩🏽‍💻📈💵

I'm willing to adapt and try new things to level up my skills. 🧠📚

I like iced coffee, spicy chips 🌶️, and dark chocolate 🍫.
